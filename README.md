## Projects

### Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) Factors Analysis
Analyzed a dataset that recorded a multitude of factors ranging from age, hypertension status, work type, relationship status, average glucose levels, smoking status, etc., of different subjects within an experiment. Visualized the counts of each subject based on gender, hypertension status, heart disease status, relationship status, work type, residence type, and smoking status. Also visualized stroke incidence based on work type, residence type, and smoking status. Encoded the factors of the subjects in order to analyze and visualize the correlation between each factor and stroke incidence. Calculated and visualized stroke incidence for different age groups and performed a T-Test to highlight age as a strong predictor for a stroke. Utilized Pandas libraries, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy.stats.

### Power Plant Sustainability
Analyzed a dataset that includes all the power plants in California with their respective characteristics. Created a secondary dataset that was then merged with the primary dataset for efficiency in the code. Used data science techniques to import, clean, and organize the data for visualization and analysis. Utilized the Pandas library to merge the data and Matplotlib to visualize a geospatial scatter plot and a bar plot.
